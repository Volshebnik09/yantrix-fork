# Yantrixâ€”Opinionated FSM Framework

Yantrix is a TypeScript framework that provides a set of tools to create robust and self-documented functional applications by code generation.
The business logic is represented by declarative, event-driven [finite state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), while the application state is an [Anemic Domain Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemic_domain_model), making it great a counterpart to any traditional state manager like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), while allowing devs to focus on describing contracts and workflows, rather than writing and debugging the
actual code.

Lends itself perfectly to [Architecture-as-Code](https://jondavid-black.github.io/AaC/) paradigm and no-code/less-code tools for developers, like [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n).

## Installation

To install Yantrix, you can use NPM, Yarn or PNPM:

```bash
npm install yantrix
# or
yarn add yantrix
# or
pnpm install yantrix
```

## Usage 

See [API Reference](https://tfcp68.github.io/yantrix/API-Reference/) 

## Sample Diagrams

### Dropdown Control

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
	[*] --> INIT: RESET (optionsList)
    note left of [*]
    #( items = [], selectedIndex = 0 }
    end note
    INIT-->CLOSED: RESET (optionsList)
    CLOSED --> OPEN: OPEN
    OPEN --> CLOSED: CLOSE
    OPEN --> SELECTED: SELECT (index)
    SELECTED --> CLOSED: CLOSE
    note right of INIT
    +Initial
    +ByPass
    #{ items, selectedIndex } <= (sortBy(optionsList, 'id'), 0)
    end note
    note left of CLOSED
    subscribe/click => OPEN
    emit/dropdownClose
    end note
    note left of SELECTED
    #{ selectedIndex } <= (index)
    emit/selected {selectedIndex} => (index)
    subscribe/selected => CLOSE
    end note
    note right of OPEN
    emit/dropdownOpen
    subscribe/click (index) => SELECT
    subscribe/clickOutside => CLOSE
    end note
```

-   `+Initial` marks that **INIT** is the initial `State` of the `FSM`. `+ByPass` also implies that transition through this `State` is synchronous
-   `#{items, selectedIndex}` describes a shape of `Context` for all `States`. `items` is the list of dropdown values, and `selectedIndex` stores currently selected item. Without extra expressions these values are copied from the preceding `Context`
-   `#{items=[], selectedIndex = 0}` sets the initial value for that `Context`
-   `#{items, selectedIndex} <= (sortBy(optionsList, 'id'), 0)` fills both `Context` properties from `Payload`:
    - `items` is a sorted `optionsList` property, assuming it's a List of Objects that have property of `id`.
    - `selectedIndex` is set to 0, when the options list is updated
-   `subscribe/click => OPEN` in **CLOSED** state produces **OPEN** `Action` on incoming `click` `Event`, which transitions the `FSM` into **OPEN** state
-   likewise, `subscribe/click (index) => SELECT` produces **SELECT** `Action` and passes `index` property from `Event Meta` to its `Payload`, which transitions the `FSM` into the **SELECTED** `State`
-   `subscribe/clickOutside => CLOSE` produces a **CLOSE** `Action` to return the dropdown to the original `State` (**CLOSED**)
-   Both **CLOSED** and **OPEN** `States` emit corresponding `Events`, that are pipelined into `Event Bus` and connect the component to others.
-   **SELECTED** is a transitional `State`: while `emit/selected <= (index)` lets the `Event Bus` know which item was selected, at the same time `subscribe/selected => CLOSE` transitions the `FSM` back to **CLOSED** `State` via **CLOSE** `Action`. It behaves similar to **INIT** `State` &ndash; the `FSM` goes through it. However, unlike that case, here it will emit `Event` and wait for its settlement before it runs further processing.
