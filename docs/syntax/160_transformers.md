# Transformers

`Transformers` are projection-type functions that are bundled with `Slice` and translate types between each other.

## Generic Transformers

There are built-in pure functions that operate on any contract type and map the values. They are the basic building
blocks of data manipulation. They can be user-defined and are injected at build-time

### Examples

-   `add($value1, $value2)`
-   `find(#listValue, 'id', 4)`
-   `mult(mean(#listValue), $count)`

## Context Transformers

They translate `Contexts` between each other and are used inside [`Reducers`](110_reducers.html) to update internal data
of the `FSM` when changing `States`. They are defined as a part of `State Dictionary` and can be injected at compile
time.

### Examples

-   `#{stepIndex} <= nextStep(#stepIndex)`
-   `#{email, password, input_error} <= sanitize(#email), sanitize(#password), validate(#email, #password)}`

## Reducer Transformers

Function that translate from `State`+`Action/Payload` to `State/Context` can be injected into `FSM`s at compile time.

-   `#{propertyA, propertyB} = reducerA(#propertyA, $payloadA, reducerB(#propertyB, $payloadB)`

## Model Transformers

Model transformers are a subtype of `Effects` that are context-free and are basically functions that mutates
the `Data Model`.

-   `#{counter} <= add(â„–counter, increaseGlobalCounter($value))`

They can be composed with `Predicates` to create conditional mutations, but this approach is not recommended, since it
splits the responsibility of `Effects`.
