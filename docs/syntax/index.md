# Yantrix diagram syntax

## Mermaid

Yantrix extends [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax to describe business logic, which is then transpiled into
one of popular programming languages. This allows to effortlessly visualize data flow and control states, blending well
into [Documentation-As-Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)
and [Everything-As-Code](https://hackernoon.com/everything-as-code-explained-0ibg32a3) paradigms.

Yantrix currently supports [State Diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/stateDiagram.html) and aims to
support [Sequence Diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html)
and [Class Diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/classDiagram.html) as well.

Example of a State Diagram, implementing an `until` loop:

```
direction LR
[*] --> LOOP_BEGIN: START_LOOP(counter)
LOOP_BEGIN --> LOOP_REPEAT: ITERATE
state loop_ends <<choice>>
LOOP_REPEAT --> loop_ends: [-]
loop_ends --> LOOP_REPEAT: isGreater($counter,0)
loop_ends --> LOOP_END
note right of LOOP_BEGIN
    #{ counter } <= $counter = 1
end note
note left of LOOP_REPEAT
    +ByPass
    #{ counter } <= add(#counter, -1)
end note
```

And this is how Mermaid renders it:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
	direction LR
	[*] --> LOOP_BEGIN: START_LOOP(counter)
	LOOP_BEGIN --> LOOP_REPEAT: ITERATE
	state loop_ends <<choice>>
	LOOP_REPEAT --> loop_ends: [-]
	loop_ends --> LOOP_REPEAT: isGreater($counter,0)
	loop_ends --> LOOP_END
	note right of LOOP_BEGIN
		#{ counter } <= $counter = 1
	end note
	note left of LOOP_REPEAT
		+ByPass
		#{ counter } <= add(#counter, -1)
	end note
```

**Notice:** Please be informed that this particular diagram is not a good application of Yantrix, but rather is
presented for demonstration purposes.

## State Machine

The first layer of syntax is describing a `FSM` &mdash; [Finite State Machine](../concepts/200_FSM.html).

The diagram above creates a `FSM` with 3 `States`:

-   **LOOP_BEGIN**
-   **LOOP_REPEAT**
-   **LOOP_END**

They are written in uppercase on purpose, to be easily identified in a diagram source, but generally can be any
alphanumeric identifiers.

The diagram also defines 2 `Actions`:

-   **START_LOOP** with a `Payload` that carries a single `counter` variable
-   **ITERATE** without a `Payload`

Since **ITERATE** can be invoked in two of three `States`(**LOOP_BEGIN** and **LOOP_REPEAT**), **LOOP_END** has no
transitions out of it. However, an `Action` that is coming ot ouf a default node (`[*]`) can be dispatched from
any `State`. Thus, **START_LOOP** `Action` effectively resets the whole machine to starting conditions. That is a very
useful pattern for proper `FSM` designs

Invoking **ITERATE** `Action` at **LOOP_REPEAT** `State` leads to a `Fork`, which has to calculate the predicate `greaterThan(${counter}, 0)`. If its truthy, the transition leads to **LOOP_END**. If not, the remaining transition makes a loop, invoking **LOOP_REPEAT** -> **LOOP_REPEAT** transition, yet again executing all operations in `notes` blocks, as described below.

Since **LOOP_REPEAT** has a `ByPass` flag, it passes **ITERATE** `Action` to oneself, looping again and again, until the Fork resolves to **LOOP_END** `State`.

## Subsyntax

Yantrix diagrams are built on top of Mermaid syntax for State Machines: there's an embedded subsyntax to describe data
flow, effects and event model. That makes Yantrix itself a programming language that requires a bit of learning in order
to use efficiently. The syntax reflects the state-machine lifecycle and mostly translates to or from reducers
implemented via
code generation.

Yantrix subsyntax is a functional language by design, and each line of it is supposed to be independent of the others.
The best comparison could be Excel/Google Sheets formulas, that are:

-   are computed derivatives of the state
-   are executed and calculated in rounds
-   can depend on each other but not within one round of calculation

So despite lines of code are written in order, the result of their transpilation should not be dependent on line order
as much as it goes.

Every line starts with a `Directive` which defines the character of operation and is the most basic semantic entity in
Yantrix:

-   [**Data Objects**](100_data_objects.html)
    -   [Reducers](110_reducers.html)
    -   [Values and Constants](120_values_and_constants.html)
    -   [Expressions](130_expressions.html)
-   [**Functions**](140_functions.md)
    -   [Predicates](150_predicates.html)
    -   [Transformers](160_transformers.html)
-   [**Event pub/sub**](200_events.html)
    -   [subscribe](210_subscribe.html)
    -   [emit](220_emit.html)
-   [**Side Effects**](300_side_effects.html)
