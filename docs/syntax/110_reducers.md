# Reducers

Reducers are a subset of [fold functions](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)>) that have
signature of

```
(previousState, action) => newState
```

Most importantly, reducers are [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function). That means the updated
data state is dependent solely on the current `State` and whatever data is carried with `Action`

All `Reducers` are called within `FSM`s, that are generated with code from Yantrix diagrams, and are the essence of the
framework and the most important concept to conceive for using Yantrix. They are the carrier of application logic,
delivered in tiny bundles, each attached to a certain `State` of the finite state machine and it's possible transitions,
which are atomic and transactional.

Reducers in Yantrix starts with `#` directive followed by braces:

```
''' Sets "newState" Context value equal to "previousState" value of current Context
#{ newState } <= #previousState

''' Sets "newState" Context value equal to "actionPayload" of invoked Action
#{ newState } <= $actionPayload
```

Here, `{}` braces group `#` operation, which is a reference to the `State` attribute, usually called a `Context`,
while `$` operation is dereferencing an `Action` meta information, usually called a `Payload`.

Because the result of `Reducer` is new `State` and `Context`, braces on the left side of assignment are not technically
dereferencing anything, but for the sake of semantics they can only be figured (`{}`), as listed properties must belong
to the `Context` interface.

For more info, see [Data Objects](100_data_objects.md)

## Functions and Expressions

Every `Reducer` can reference any number of variable names both on left and right side of assignment. All required
properties are added to the `Context` dynamically, if needed. but each key can be listed only once.

If there're more properties in `Target Object` than in `Source Object` , excessive`Target Object` properties are left
empty.

If there're more properties in `Source Object` than in `Target Object`, such a diagram will throw an Error

```
''' assigns Null to the latter property, and copieis the rest
#{ property1, property2, property 3 } <= #property2, #property3

''' copies values in order of reference
# { property1, property2, property 3 } <= $payloadA, $payloadB, $payloadC

''' throws an error due to excessive properties on the right side
# { property1, property 2} <= $payloadA, $payloadB, $payloadC
```

As high-order functions, `Reducers` can invoke other `Functions`, including those which can dereference both at the same
time

```
''' functions are called by composition. Here we use "foo" property of the `Context`
#{ foo } <=  add(#foo, random(0, 1))

''' any combination of Context or Payload properties can be referenced
#{ foo } <= add (#foo, #bar, someFunc(#foo, #bar))
#{ accumulatedValue } <= add( $payloadValueA, $payloadValueB )
```

## Referencing inside Expressions

There's a `#{}` dereferencing construction in a reducer, and it's on the left side of `<=` assignment, because
the `Reducer` is supposed to return `Context` properties. However, `Context` and `Payload` properties can be referenced
in any expressions using symbols:

-   `#prop` dereferences a `Context` property named `prop`
-   `$prop2` dereferences a `Payload` property named `prop2`
-   `%%value` dereferences a build-time [Constant](120_values_and_constants.md) named `value`

```
#{ bar, jazz } <= sum($payloadA), coalesce(#jazz, $payloadB)
#{ value } <= lookup(#accumulatedValue, $payloadB)
```
