# Constants

## Type system

As of now, data contracts in diagrams do not have typings.

When exporting Typescript code, they are declared as `any`. However, FSM itself (it's `States` and `Actions`) is typed along with [Automata](../API-reference/automata/) instance.

For other languages Yantrix aims to provide compatibility with elementary types, existing in most languages:

-   **Numbers**: integer and floats are processed as similarly as possible for a given language
-   **Strings**: strings are processed as immutables, i.e. every string function should return a new string rather than modify one of its arguments
-   **Lists (Tuples)**: Lists and Tuples are processed as similarly as possible for a given language. They also are immutable and can only be a read-only argument of the calling function
-   **Objects(Dictionaries)**: implementation is highly language-dependent and aims to reproduce the behaviour of Typescript [`Record`](../API%-reference/automata/interfaces/IAutomata.html) implementation as closely as possible. For `Functions` implementation **Object** arguments should be defined as immutable and read-only.

## Constant declaration

All but **Object** types can be created in-place, assigning a member of `Context` or `Payload` or as a `Function` argument

- `1` or `1.05` is the way to create a Number. Other numeric representations (e.g. hex, exponential, etc.) are supported as long as the target language supports them
- `'foo'` creates a String primitive
-   `[]` creates an empty List
-   `$(foo)` is a compile-time Constant, that is passed to a Codegen along with a Mermaid diagram, primarily being used for behaviour that is dependent on environment and/or CI/CD operations.
